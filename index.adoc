[[reporting-bugs]]
=== Reporting Bugs

Before reporting a bug or requesting a new feature, please consider these general points:

- Check that someone hasn't already filed the bug or feature request by searching, or running custom
  queries in, the link:https://tree.taiga.io/project/taiga/issues[issue tracker].
- Check the right repository to use for reporting an issue: bugs related to UI should go to *taiga-front*,
  but if something is broken on the backend, an issue should be opened on the *taiga-back* repository.
- Ask on the link:http://groups.google.com/d/forum/taigaio[mailing list] first if you're not sure if
  what you're seeing is a bug.
- Don't use the GitHub issues system to ask support questions. Use the
  link:http://groups.google.com/d/forum/taigaio[mailing list] for that.
- Donâ€™t use GitHub issues for lengthy discussions, because they're likely to get lost. If a particular
  ticket is controversial, please move the discussion to the
  link:http://groups.google.com/d/forum/taigaio[mailing list].
