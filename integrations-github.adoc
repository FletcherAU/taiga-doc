*GitHub* is the largest code host on the planet with over 17.5 million repositories. These repositories are open to the community for public projects and secure for private ones.

== What can we do currently?

Right now you can connect to a GitHub repository with a Taiga project and generate a one-way communication (from GitHub to Taiga) to:

- *Change the status of an epic, user story, issue, or task in Taiga with the commit message*: you may want to read more about this feature in the article link:changing-elements-status-via-commit-message.html["Changing elements status via commit message"].
- *Attach commits in an epic, user story, issue, or task of Taiga with the commit message*: you may want to read more about this feature in the article link:attach-commits-to-elements-via-commit-message.html["Attach commits to elements via commit message"].
- *Create issues on Taiga when they are created on GitHub*.
- *Add comments to the connected issues on Taiga when they are created on GitHub*.

In Taiga an issue is connected with a GitHub issue if it was created by the GitHub integration. In the detail page of an issue on Taiga you can see a link under the subject to the original issue in GitHub.


== And what can't we do?

- *Dual synchronization*: currently the integration functionality only allows receiving messages from GitHub. Taiga can't communicate with GitHub (the one-way communication is from Github to Taiga), so changes made in Taiga won't be reflected in GitHub.
- *Show commit links in Taiga issues*: If you name a story, task or issue in a commit message (by its reference number) a link to commit won't appear in Taiga.
- *Sync current GitHub issues and comment when the integration module in Taiga is enabled*: the integration only works with the future issues and comments added in GitHub.

[WARNING]
====
Integration will always take time so please be patient. If you need a specific integration and you feel ready to get a machete and get into the Taiga, please review our link:http://docs.taiga.io/api.html[API Docs] and our section in `Taiga` resources about link:https://community.taiga.io/t/how-can-i-contribute/159["How you can contribute?"].
If you need help with a specific feature, you can always get in touch with our community through our link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/taigaio[mailing list].

== Configure the integration module in Taiga

. Go to *Admin > Integrations > GitHub*
. Fill *secret key* or use the auto generated one
. Copy the *payload URL* input

== Configure Webhooks in your GitHub repository

[WARNING]
====
Be careful if you use *organization webhooks* instead of *repository webhooks* because the first emit calls for events in all of the repositories and the second only in one of them.
====

. Click on *Settings > Webhooks & Services > Add webhook*
. On that screen set the *payload url* with the *payload url* from Taiga
. The *secret key* must be filled with the same content as the *secret key* from Taiga
. Content type must be *application/json*.
. Taiga currently listens for three different kind of *events*. Just check *"send me everything"* or the events you want Taiga to listen for.
.. *Push events*: changing element status via commit message
.. *Issues*: issues created in GitHub appear automatically in Taiga
.. *Issue comment*: issue comments created in GitHub appear automatically in Taiga
. Press *Add webhook* button to create the new webhook
