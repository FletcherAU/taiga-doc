*Gogs* is a self-hosted Git service written in Go.


== What can we do currently?

Right now you can connect a Gogs repository with a Taiga project and generate a one-way communication (from Gogs to Taiga) to:

- *Change the status of an epic, user story, issue, or task in Taiga with the commit message*: you may want to read more about this feature in the article link:changing-elements-status-via-commit-message.html["Changing elements status via commit message"].
- *Attach commits in an epic, user story, issue, or task of Taiga with the commit message*: you may want to read more about this feature in the article link:attach-commits-to-elements-via-commit-message.html["Attach commits to elements via commit message"].


== And what can't we do?

- *Create issues on Taiga when they are created on Gogs*.
- *Add comments to the connected issues on Taiga when they are created on Gogs*.
- *Dual synchronization*: currently the integration functionality only allows receiving messages from Gogs. Taiga can't communicate with Gogs (the one-way communication is from Gogs to Taiga), so changes made in Taiga won't be reflected in Gogs.
- *Show commit links in Taiga issues*: If you name a story, task or issue in a commit message (by its reference number) a link to commit won't appear in Taiga.
- *Sync current Gogs issues and comment when the integration module in Taiga is enabled*: the integration only works with the future issues and comments added in Gogs.

Currently Gogs offers a limitation on its webhooks system that must be considered. It is not hardcore but it's good to know them to be aware of the limitation that exist.

- Gogs doesn't sign the messages so Taiga only can confirm the origin checking the IPs in the request.

====
Integration will always take time so please be patient. If you need a specific integration and you feel ready to get a machete and get into the Taiga, please review our link:http://taigaio.github.io/taiga-doc/dist/api.html[API Docs] and our section in `Taiga` resources about link:https://resources.taiga.io/contributions/["How you can contribute?"].
If you need help in a specific feature, you can always get in touch with the community in link:https://resources.taiga.io/[https://resources.taiga.io/].

== Configure Webhooks in your Gogs repository

Go to your repository

. Click on *Settings > Webhooks > Add webhook*
