*Slack is a platform for team communication.*

First things first, Slack is a huge platform with lots of features. Integration will always take time so please be patient. If you need a specific integration and you feel ready to get out your machete and start cutting into the taiga, please review our link:http://taigaio.github.io/taiga-doc/dist/api.html[API Docs].

If you need help with a specific feature, you can always get in touch with our community through our link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/taigaio[mailing list].
